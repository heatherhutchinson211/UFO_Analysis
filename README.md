# UFO_Analysis

## Overview
This project uses javascript and html to create an interactive UFO website.  This website includes an input table in which users can input a variety of information in order to filter through given data. 

## Results
The html file pulls data from the update app.js file in order to perform search results in the table created. 

The frontface of the website is as shown below:

You can then use the filtering table seen here to enter data such as: city, state, country, and shape.  You are then presented with results pulled from the data.js file.

## Summary

Overall, this website contains viable data to perform research one may need on UFO Sightings.
However, I would say one drawback to this project is that there may be more data out there that isnt included in the data.js file we used to pull data from.

In order to further deveopment, I would say that this website could be updated by including more filters that a user could search by.  It could also be updated by including images of each sighting if possible, to create more visually appealing results.
