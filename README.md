# UFO_Analysis

## Overview
This project uses javascript and html to create an interactive UFO website.  This website includes an input table in which users can input a variety of information in order to filter through given data. 

## Results
The html file pulls data from the update app.js file in order to perform search results in the table created. 

The frontface of the website is as shown below:

You can then use the filtering table seen here to enter data such as: city, state, country, and shape.  You are then presented with results pulled from the data.js file.
