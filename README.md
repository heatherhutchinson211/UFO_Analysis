# UFO_Analysis

## Overview
This project uses javascript and html to create an interactive UFO website.  This website includes an input table in which users can input a variety of information in order to filter through given data.

The frontface of the website is as shown below:


You can then use the filtering table seen here to enter data such as: city, state, country, and shape.  You are then presented with results pulled from the data.js file.
